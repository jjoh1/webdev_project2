            <h3>Hamilton: An American Musical</h3>
            <p>I am one of the very many people that have been amazed by the Hamilton musical. Almost every song keeps me entertained and it is easy to get them stuck in your head.</p>

                <h5>You'll Be Back</h5>
                <p>This song strongly compels me to sing along every time. It also has some humor that makes me remember it.</p>

                <h5>Non-Stop</h5>
                <p>Not only is Hamilton non-stop, this song is. I enjoy how this song puts down a lot of Hamilton's story while also being extremely entertaining. I also really like the many references to earlier parts of the musical.</p>

            <h3>Six</h3>
            <p>After being intrigued by hearing the opening song from this musical, I discovered that I enjoy almost all of the songs included in it. While it shares many similarities to a concert rather than a musical, I still was extremely entertained by it.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h5>Get Down</h5>
                <p>I find this song to be an invitation to start dacing. I also really like the song's defiance of societal norms.</p>
